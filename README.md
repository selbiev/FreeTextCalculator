# GraphicalCalculator

This project was created in order to build a powerful calculator with the possibility to put functions in and be able to see its graphical representation.

The core of this program is the Analyzer. It's capable to analyze a complex input term (respecting the operations orders) and evaluate it's result. 

The first version only works with numbers, but for the next versions it is planned to also be able to save variables, functions, their graphical representation and also other more advanced features like Derivatives, Integrals, Taylor approximations etc.
